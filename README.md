# Frontend Masters

I‚Äôm currently following the curriculum of Frontend Masters (https://frontendmasters.com/).

## ‚úÖ Javascript: The Hard Parts, v2

In this course by Will Smith, I‚Äôve learned a lot about how Javascript works. It covers the hard Javascript topics, like async, promises, how object-oriented/class programming is done in Javascript & closures.

No code along project.

## ‚úÖ Deep Javascript Foundations, v3

In this course by Kyle Simpson, I‚Äôve learned more about the in-depths of Javascript. This course learned me more about some ‚Äúweird stuff‚Äù in Javascript, and how to think about coercion, how Javascript is used as an class oriented language now, but it‚Äôs really an abstraction, and how to interact with that.

No code along project.

## ‚úÖ Complete Intro to React, V8

Brian Holt of Snowflake has given an overview of React, covering topics like JSX, Effects, Custom Hooks, React Query and context.

Code along project in which I created a pet adoption app.

## ‚úÖ Vanilla JS: You Might Not Need A Framework

Course by Maximiliano Firtman, in which he moves away from all the frameworks, and teaches how to build an app, just with Vanilla JS and Web Components. I learned about how to add reactivity using proxies and custom event handlers.

Code along project in which I created a simple coffee order app.

## ‚úÖ Web Performance Fundamentals

In this course, I learned about how to optimize websites for page load. I learned about the most important metrics (FCP, LCP), and how to improve them: optimize images, lazy loading (images and js/css), putting websites on a nearby server, etc.

No code along project.

## ‚úÖ Ultimate CSS Grid & Layout Techniques, v3

In this course I got a deeper understanding of CSS Grid and Flexbox. Mostly created grid/mosaic kind of templates.
